Corona virus Case predictor....

In this project a predictive model is created to determine the future cases based on past cases using time series algorithms.
The dataset consist of:
PatientInfo.csv
PatientRoute.csv
Covid_19_data.csv

Knn algorithm is used to group all the affected area and then different algorithms are applied to predict the future case.

we trained different model for prediction and analysis of the result.
MLP Model
Arima Model
Prophet Model
LSTM Model
